        <p>Good Morning! I'm Shawn Porto, and I'm absolutly adicted to Games. This blog is alllllll about games and my thoughts on them. Most games I'll be including in here are some of my favorite genre's, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>RPG's</li>
            <li>Tactical Games</li>
            <li>Puzzle Games</li>
            <li>Deckbuilding Games</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These different types of games are good for studying and one's that I want to understand as I get further into my career of game design.</p>
